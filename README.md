# CTN-Originals AutoHotkey Library

This AutoHotkey library adds some general functionality to the language and tools to speed up everything and make it more efficient to write with. Some of the best things in the library are:

- `console.log`: A logging function that outputs messages to the console.
- `ErrorHandling`: A set of functions to handle errors and exceptions.
- `ArrayUtilities`: A set of functions to manipulate arrays easily.
- `ObjectUtilities`: A set of functions to manipulate objects easily.


## Set-Up

To use this library, simply download the entire repository, store it either in your AutoHotkey\lib folder or store it in a project. 
Now you can include it in your AutoHotkey script using the `#Include` directive:

```ahk
#Include lib\CTN_ahk-lib\import.ahk
```
